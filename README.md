#CTU House of Delegates Display

This is the first version of the display for the Chicago Teachers Union House of Delegates meetings. It was created to aid delegates who may be unfamiliar with Robert's Rules in participating in our monthly meetings. I have begun work on a second version [here](https://github.com/goldnate/Meeting_Minder.git), but that version is in a very early stage.

To start the process open Main_Control.htm in a browser. The browser must allow popups and control of child windows. The system is designed for use with a laptop and projector in which the displays are extended, not mirrored. From the Main Controller a Main Display window will pop up and a Preview Display window will pop up. By clicking the Q&A Controller you a new window that allows control of timers and display of privileged motions and resolutions (principal motions) will open. The Reports Controller allows one to open a Deck using the File Open button on the page. See Deck20150114.htm for an example of a file that works with the Reports Controller.
