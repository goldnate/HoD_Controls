#CTU House of Delegates Display

This is the first version of the display for the Chicago Teachers Union House of Delegates meetings. It was created to aid delegates who may be unfamiliar with Robert's Rules in participating in our monthly meetings. I have begun work on a second version [here](https://github.com/goldnate/Meeting_Minder.git), but that version is in a very early stage.
