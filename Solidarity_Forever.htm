<h1>Solidarity Forever</h1>
<h3>Tune: <em>John Brown&rsquo;s Body</em>
<br/>Lyrics by Bill Chapin</h3>

<h4>    When the union's inspiration <br/>through the workers' blood shall run,</h4>
<h4>    There can be no power <br/>greater anywhere beneath the sun</h4>
<h4>    Yet what force on earth is weaker <br/>than the feeble strength of one</h4>
<h4>    But the union makes us strong.</h4>

<h4>    <em style="color: #666666;">CHORUS:</em></h4>
<h4>    Solidarity forever,</h4>
<h4>    Solidarity forever,</h4>
<h4>    Solidarity forever,</h4>
<h4>    For the union makes us strong.</h4>

<h4>    It is we who plowed the prairies <br/>built the cities where they trade</h4>
<h4>    Dug the mines and built the workshops <br/>endless miles of railroad laid</h4>
<h4>    Now we stand outcast and starving <br/>midst the wonders we have made</h4>
<h4>    But the union makes us strong.</h4>

<h4>    Chorus</h4>

<h4>    They have taken untold millions that <br/>they never toiled to earn</h4>
<h4>    But without our brain and muscle <br/>not a single wheel can turn.</h4>
<h4>    We can break their haughty power <br/>gain our freedom when we learn</h4>
<h4>    That the union makes us strong.</h4>

<h4>    Chorus</h4>

<h4>    In our hands is placed a power <br/>greater than their hoarded gold</h4>
<h4>    Greater than the might of armies <br/>magnified a thousand-fold.</h4>
<h4>    We can bring to birth a new world <br/>from the ashes of the old</h4>
<h4>For the union makes us strong.</h4>
